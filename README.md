# Gmaps-commute-optimzer
Combines the Google maps API with the Openweather API to collect data on commute times between two locations. The idea behind this was to find the optimal time in a day to commute such that you are at work for a consecutive 8 hour time period while minimizing the amount of time spent in traffic.

The program will collect data every 5 minutes and requires the coordinates of two locations and the name of the city to be input.
